# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
The E-Commerce Back End stores product information in a MySql database and organizes these information in categories and tags to be easily searched and maintained.

## Installation
To observe the back end, users must install dependencies by running the following command in terminal: 
```
npm i
```
Users must also create the database in MySql and seed it before any products can be viewed.

## Usage
Launch the application by entering the following command in terminal:
```
node server.js
```
This will open a local host connection and allow users to create, read, update, and delete products, categories, and tags (product descriptions).
