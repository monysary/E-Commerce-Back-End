# E-Commerce Back End

## Description
The E-Commerce Back End stores product information in a MySql database and organizes these information in categories and tags to be easily searched and maintained.

## Installation
To observe the back end, users must install dependencies by running the following command in terminal: 
```
npm i
```
Users must also create the database in MySql and seed it before any products can be viewed.

## Usage
Launch the application by entering the following command in terminal:
```
node server.js
```
This will open a local host connection and allow users to create, read, update, and delete products, categories, and tags (product descriptions). The back end database stores information in three main tables: product information, categories to organize the products, and tags to give the products description. The back end application allows the platform to be able to view the three main tables as well as create new entries, update entries, and delete entries within each table. A demonstration on how the database is accessed can be found below.
